<p>My name is Justin Lim. I am currently a university student studying bioinformatics at UCSD. My enjoy coding in R and C++, but I have a lot to learn so I hope that collecting what I learn on a website will help me out. I am also dating this super cute girl so thatâ€™s good.</p>
<p>As far as bioinformatics goes, I am interested in understanding protein folding and molecular design.</p>
